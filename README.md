## Utils (work-in-progress)

This collection of common helper functions is used to build HTTP services in Golang. It provides:
- Quick setup for local integration test frameworks with docker & database (Postgres).
- Some basic HTTP frameworks regarding authentication & marshaling payload from requests, etc.

These are commonly used functions in multiple of the HTTP services we have in the team.
The underlying HTTP framework is [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo).
