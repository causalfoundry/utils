## Utils (work-in-progress)

This is a collection of common helper functions we use in building http services in Golang. It provides several services as follows:
- Quick setup for local integration test frameworks with docker & database (postgres).
- Some basic HTTP frameworks regarding authentication & marshaling payload from requests

These are commonly used functions in multiple of the http services we have in the team.
Underlying HTTP framework is [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo).
